### syrjs_static

This project is intended to be:

 - a tool for the interactive portion of syr(js) events (code challenges, etc.)
 - a community-based OSS project for those who want to contribute to the features available for syr(js) events, or to simply gain experience contributing to OSS projects in general

This project is a [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) single page application created using Nuxt.js. For a detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
